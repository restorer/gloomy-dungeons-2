# Gloomy Dungeons II

Gloomy Dungeons II is a continuation of old–school 3d–shooter (Gloomy Dungeons 3D) in the style of Doom and Wolfenstein.
Second part still use wolf-like engine (but *not* raycasting), but this time engine improved a bit:

  - Simple lighting effects
  - Different floor and ceiling textures in each cell
  - Extruded ceiling and doors
  - Rocket launcher
